# VulnFox: Agent-less Vulnerability Management Framework  

## 1. What is VulnFox?  

VulnFox is an **Agent-less vulnerability management framework** that focuses on integrating a diverse range of asset inventories and automatically correlating them with known CVE vulnerability information. Instead of installing agents or performing active scans, VulnFox gathers asset data from multiple sources such as active asset discovery, Network Access Control (NAC), passive network analysis, protocol analysis, and descriptor analysis. This multi-source approach not only enhances asset identification accuracy but also ensures that the security posture for IT, IoT, OT, and cloud environments is continuously updated with the latest vulnerability insights.

## 2. Core Features  
#### 2.1 Fully Agent-less Vulnerability Detection  
- **No Endpoint Installation Required**: VulnFox eliminates the need for endpoint agents and active scanning tools.  
- **Passive Network Monitoring**: Utilizes network traffic analysis and metadata extraction to detect vulnerabilities.  
- **Real-Time Asset Identification**: Leverages NAC to continuously update asset inventories.

#### 2.2 NAC-Driven Asset & Vulnerability Management  
- **Network-Based Asset Inventory**: Retrieves up-to-date asset information using NAC authentication logs and network metadata.  
- **Automated CVE Correlation**: Automatically maps known vulnerabilities to discovered network assets for precise risk assessment.  
- **Zero Performance Impact**: Operates without interfering with device performance or network operations.

#### 2.3 Multi-Layered Vulnerability Management Strategy  

- **Supports Integration with External Vulnerability Reports**: Enables security teams to correlate VulnFox asset intelligence with external vulnerability reports for a unified security assessment.  
- **Low-Cost, Scalable Deployment**: Eliminates the overhead of agent licensing, endpoint maintenance, and active scanning.  
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Seamlessly syncs with sources like NVD, MITRE ATT&CK, and other industry threat intelligence platforms.
